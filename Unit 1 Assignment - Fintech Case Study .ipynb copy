    "Most known as FICO, our credit score was supposedly created to tell institutions how a certain individual manages their personal finance or how well they \"deal with money\" so that these institutions can make credit-related decisions on the possibilities of the individual repaying the loan on time. The FICO score given will determine the financial risk of the individual that will influence the accessibility and cost for him/her to borrow money of finance a purchase. Therefore, heavily impacting his ability to grow financially and acquire new assets. "

Yet, it's one of the heaviest concentrated industries where only 3 credit bureaus control over 90% of the market. With the industry in the hands of Equifax, TransUnion and Experian, there is doubts whether they use all information available or only the ones that they will easily have access to in a low cost operation. \n",

This landscape although has a high barrier for new entrants creates a perfect landscape for Fintechs to enter through the back door. In this case study we will analyze how one fintech startup is doing it."

Such model, uses a non linear ensemble function to take both the data and the model scores as its own inputs to produce a decision. As the model builds submodels before processing in a single neural network, it allows the tool to select the correct balance to weight the decision in each submodel according to specific variables set by the financial institution.

    "While in the recent past a business or person needed to prove a solid financial track record to get credit, new data sources are becoming more reliable in such decision making processes. Innovations such as the integrations of APIs that give to the underwriter the ability to pull data from different sources is a major trend that has impacted the industry across the board. Other than credit bureaus and bank recors, data points gathered through lien searches, social networks, online transaction records and cloud based accounting systems are reaching the credit underwriters through these APIs and providing a closer look at the borrower. Data points on a borrower used to make a decision has increased in the industry overall, in ZEST AI specifically, the startup estimates to use over 10 times more data than the traditional methods its clients were using before. \n",

    "The scenario of the competition ZEST AI finds itself in is tricky to understand. While its clients can significantly increase profits while reducing risk by using ZAML, they can become its strongest competitor if they decide to put the money and time into it. Considering companies such as Rocket Mortgage, SoFi and Zillow that all have a very strong customer base, let alone banks, ZEST AI is forced to always have its AI model at the forefront of innovation and effectiveness. Otherwise, the ROI for its clients to create their own models would be something they would be willing to take the risk. "

Discover Financial Services, a leading direct banking and payments company with $90.5 billion dollars in loans, approached Zest in 2018 with the goal to improve its credit scoring to reduce risk and at the same time increase approvals and market share. After a succesful trial, Discover deployed its first credit under writing Machine Learning model into production in mid-2019. Zest capability allowed Discover to personalize the model to its preferences on the applicants' behaviors. For example, a history of discount store shopping would increase the applicant's chance of being approved for a personal loan while on the other hand calls from Skype or untracked phones would lower the chances.

It's unthinkable of banks sharing their data with competitors, but this would not be a raw data sharing, they would only use to better predict outcomes in their models leaving the actual information encrypted.

Altough fair and correct, such regulation present a serious threat to the AI developed by Zest with the limitation of data points input.
